HOW TO COMPILE UNDER METROMS:

Example given for Arctic 20km, coupled ROMS-CICE:
This has been tested on Intel computer, using Gfortran
and Ubuntu 12.04. C-shell must be installed for CICE compilation.

Start with seting the METROMS_MYHOST and METROMS_TMPDIR environmental 
variables by souring the myenv.bash file (or similar method). 
source ./myenv.bash alvin

On the Vilje supercomputer, load modules by sourcing modules.sh.
source ./modules.sh

1:
Build MCT by executing './build_mct.sh' in metroms/apps-folder.

2:
Build CICE by executing './build_cice.sh arctic-20km'. Optionally, 
give as arguments the numbers of processors you will use in x and 
y-direction in your CICE application. 

3:
In folder metroms/apps, execute './build_roms.sh arctic-20km' 
to build roms-3.6 arctic-20km application. To compile in paralell, 
add the keyword '-j 4' after the name of your application to use 
4 cpus in the compilation process. You still need to specify which 
compiler etc you want to use inside the 'build_roms.sh'-file.
